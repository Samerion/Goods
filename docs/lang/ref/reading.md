## Goodish script

The Goods don't have an alphabet — instead, they have symbols which represent full words. Each symbol, however,
can mean more than just one word, the meaning depends on the context.

**Note:** Currently, the symbols are not available. They will be added later.

The script can be represented using latin letters, which is useful for storing them on a computer. This form is
always provided for every case in this repo.

## Reading

The latin form of the script is based on the pronouncation of each word. Each character represents the same character
in the [IPA] with the exception of "e", which is the equivalent of "ɛ". A detailed list of characters and their
spellings is available below.
