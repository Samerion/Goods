## Sentence structure

Each sentence always begins with its subjects. Those are then followed with their descriptions.

> \[subjects\] \[description\]
> gu iga guud \
> *I'm a good*

In the case above, the subject is "gu" (which means "me"). "iga" could be interpreted as "is" (or "am" in this case),
but its actual role is to tell us what the next words are, as Goodish reuses words by putting them in categories.

> gu — "Me" \
> iga — The next word is an iga-word. \
> guud — "Good"

If we replaced "iga" with, "ike" for example, "guud" would then mean something completely different!

> gu ike guud \
> *I'm talking.*

**Note:** The subjects area always from "iga".

## Different descriptions

We can describe the subject with words from multiple different categories.

> gu iga guud ike gu [gukop](../dict/gu.md#gukop) \
> *I'm a good and I'm here, eating* (imprecise)
