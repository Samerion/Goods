# Good lore

## Creation and discovery

The Goods were created by one of the Armitris gods, Nerraek, in the [Second Phase](#phases). He built a mountain
for them to dig and live in, and they have been doing so ever since.

Humans and others didn't know about their existence until the Fourth Phase, when one Sargonian found their cave.
He entered it, and upon meeting the first Good he was instantly attacked. Later, other people tried going in to explore
the place, thinking Goods were just some animals or monsters, but soon realised they are actually intelligent
and that the caves go much deeper than they expected!

The Goods, however, didn't take them very friendly. Most of them attacked the "intruders" on sight, although some
adventurers succeeded in having more peaceful interactions â€” they failed to understand though, as the Goods spoke
a different language! Later, some have learnt it, and even some Goods have learnt human language. Neither were fluent,
but they could at least communicate. Still, the cave inhibitants didn't really like the visits and continued attacking
new guests.

### Phases

The time in Armitris, the game's world, is split into "phases". Phases are set based on important changes to the world
the gods make. Many describe Armitris as an ever changing world, a world that is still being created.
